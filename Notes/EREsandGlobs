ECE 331 Notes

Testing Problem 2 on HW3:
	$ ls -d *
	Makefile
	.ko (Kernal Object)
	$ sudo insmod systimer.ko
	
	Do not apt-get upgrade
	Back up image with tar
	
	This allows the user to make Kernal modules

ERE vs globs:
	ERE:
		- can be used to search in vi
		- gernal Pattern matching
		
		Characters:
			. -any single char
			^ -start of line position
			$ -End of line position
			[] -Char class (a single in the class). [^ ] negate char class, to exclude from search. \d (escape). not necissary for single char.
			\
			| -alternation note use '[ab]' vs 'a|b'. 
			() -
			Modifiers: after the modified 'suffix'
			* - 0 or more
			+ - 1 or more
			? - 0 or 1
			{} - {m} exactly m times. {,m} up to including m times. {m,n} at least m but no more than n times.
		
		Note: grep prints entire lines where RE matches
		EX: write an ERE that matches a line with only decimal numbers ->
			grep '^[0-9]+$' 	(^ between beginning and end of line only contain [0-9]$)

		EX: grep American Currency looking for -> '$42' - '$19.95' - '42 dollars' - 'USD' - 'blank owes $1,000.00'
			grep '\$-?	[0-9]{0,3},?

	glob:
		Characters:
			*
			?
			[]
			^
			~
			{}
			.
